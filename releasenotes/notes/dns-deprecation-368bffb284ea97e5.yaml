upgrade:
  - puppet-designate no longer maintains a configuration directory (and it's
    contents) in /var/lib/designate/bind9
deprecations:
  - The class designate::dns has been deprecated. It took care of setting up
    the /var/lib/designate/bind9 directory and the zones.config file which are
    no longer managed by puppet-designate. Use designate::backend::bind9
    instead.
